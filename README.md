>*(A-Z/1-9) FIX -> 694*

For anyone who wants to send someone an e621 post. Works just like official means, just more consistent and flexible! No restrictions, and URLs can end with filenames!

----

### Why should I use this?

- No restrictions on who or what can fetch the content.
- Media URLs are shorter and straight-forwards.
- Works just about the same as official e6.
- Embed accounts for contributors, even for e926.
- Media size in embeds are consistent, meaning pixel art can be seen in embeds just like a 4K image.
